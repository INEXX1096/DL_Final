## Overview

This project evaluates **multimodal prompt injection attacks** on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and tests **OCR-based defenses**.

- Implements 8 types of image-based prompt injection attacks.
- Measures **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**, **semantic shift**, and **behavioral changes**.
- Applies **diffusion-based cleaning** and OCR defenses to neutralize attacks.
- Provides visualization tools for comparing attacked vs. defended images.
