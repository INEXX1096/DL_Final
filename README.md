## Overview

This project evaluates **multimodal prompt injection attacks** on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and investigates the effectiveness of **OCR-based defenses** and **diffusion-based input cleaning**.

Key components of the project include:

- Implementation of **8 image-based prompt injection attack types**
- Quantitative evaluation using:
  - **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**
  - **Semantic Shift**
  - **Behavioral Change**
- Defense strategies based on:
  - **Diffusion-based image cleaning**
  - **OCR-based text sanitization**
- Visualization tools for qualitative comparison between:
  - DIffusion clean images
  - Attacked images
  - Defended images
