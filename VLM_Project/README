## Dataset & Google Drive Setup

Due to the large size of the image dataset, all images are hosted on Google Drive.

This project was developed and tested in **Google Colab**, where the dataset is accessed via:

/content/drive/MyDrive/VLM_Project/

Please download the dataset from the link below and place the folder under:

/content/drive/MyDrive/

so that the final structure looks like:

/content/drive/MyDrive/VLM_Project/
├── attack_dataset/
├── attack_dataset_diffusion/
├── metadata/
└── ...
