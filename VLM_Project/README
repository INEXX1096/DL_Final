Dataset and Files

Due to the large number of images, the full dataset is not included in this repository.

Please download the image folder from the following Google Drive link:

🔗 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pjagUrEKweA9xn1RzT3idxUvOYN3Z7Gj?usp=drive_link

After downloading, place the folder into the following directory:

VLM_Project/


⚠️ Important:
The code assumes this directory structure. If the files are not placed inside the `VLM_Project` folder, the scripts will not be able to locate the images correctly.
